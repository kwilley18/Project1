# Project1

In this assignment, we were given the freedom to make any tyoe of website using the given list of APIs. 
The API that was chosen was called BoredAPI and Weather Dashboard. First, the website prompts the user for their location so that they know the weather 
for that day. Next, they can chose on what type of activity they want. For example, if they want an activity that has a certain price range, they must enter the 
min and max price.
